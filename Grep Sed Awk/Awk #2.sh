#You are given a file with four space separated columns containing
#the scores of students in three subjects. The first column contains
#a single character (A-Z), the student identifier. The next three
#columns have three numbers each. The numbers are between 0 and 100,
#both inclusive. These numbers denote the scores of the students in
#English, Mathematics, and Science, respectively.

#Your task is to identify whether each of the students has passed or failed.
#A student is considered to have passed if (s)he has a score 50 or more
#in each of the three subjects.

# || <- similar to concatentation in SQL

awk '{print $1,":", $2<50 || $3<50 || $4<50? "Fail":"Pass"}'
