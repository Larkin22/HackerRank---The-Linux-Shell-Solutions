#You are given a file of text, where each line contains a number
#(which may be either an integer or have decimal places).
#There will be no extra characters other than the number or the
#newline at the end of each line. Sort the lines in descending order
#- such that the first line holds the (numerically) largest number
#and the last line holds the (numerically) smallest number.

#-n sorts on numeric field and -r reverses the order:

sort -n -r
