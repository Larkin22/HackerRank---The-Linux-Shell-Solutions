'''
Sort Options:

- The vanilla sort command simply sorts the lines of the input file in
  lexicographical order.

- The -n option sorts the file on the basis of the numeric fields available
  if the first word or column in the file is a number.

- The -r option reverses the sorting order to either the reverse of the usual
  lexicographical ordering or descending order while sorting in numerical mode.

- The -k option is useful while sorting a table of data (tsv, csv etc.)
  based on a specified column (or columns).

- The -t option is used while specifying a delimiter in a particular file
  where columns are separated by tabs, spaces, pipes etc.

Given a text file, order the lines in lexicographical order.'''
