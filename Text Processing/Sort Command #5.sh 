#about American cities, in TSV (tab-separated) format. The first column
#is the name of the city and the next four columns are the average
#temperature in the months of Jan, Feb, March and April (see the sample input).

#Rearrange the rows of the table in descending order of the values for the
#average temperature in January.

#The -k option is useful while sorting a table of data (tsv, csv etc.)
#based on a specified column (or columns).
